### Description
      
This is a simple app that allows the user to name a burger of their choice, virtually "devour" it at their leisure, and then re-create it if desired. While this program may not have much of a professional application, sometimes it's just nice to hone full-stack skills on something fun.

Burger is powered by mySQL and Express on the back-end, with Express Handlebars to render the HTML and jQuery on the front-end for API communication.

### Usage
  
Usage for this app is very straightforward.  

- Once the page loads, you will see a list on the left of "un-devoured" burgers, with an option to devour.  These are ones that you or previous users have submitted.  On the right you will see burgers that have been "devoured, and an option to "Make Another."
- Clicking on the corresponding buttons noted above will move the given burger to the other category/column.
- At the bottom of the page is an input field where you can name your own burger to be added to the list.  Simply type what you would like for your burger to be named and click the "submit" button, and it will be added to the list of "un-devoured" burgers.

You can view a demonstration of the application below:
